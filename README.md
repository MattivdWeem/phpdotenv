phpdotenv
=========

PHP library to read envoirment variables


#### .env?
.env files are envoirment files, files and date which you typacly don't want to share with the whole wide world. By the use of .env files you can easily give these files premissions and git ignore them.

#### There are tons of librarys and build in functions for this?
Well yea thats true, but this version works a bit different; We use an envoirment folder this makes it easy for switching envoirments, but will also help with keeping your code clean.

#### How to use it?

	composer mattivdweem/phpdotenv
